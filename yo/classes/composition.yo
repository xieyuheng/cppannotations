In the class tt(Person) objects are used as data members. This construction
technique is called emi(composition).

Composition is neither extraordinary nor bf(C++) specific: in bf(C)
a tt(struct) or tt(union) field is commonly used in other compound types. In
bf(C++) it requires some special thought as their initialization sometimes is
subject to restrictions, as discussed in the next few sections.
