The possibility to pass arguments to constructors allows us to monitor the
construction order of objects during program execution.  This is illustrated
by the next program using a class tt(Test). The program defines a global
tt(Test) object and two local tt(Test) objects. The order of construction is
as expected: first global, then main's first local object, then tt(func)'s
local object, and then, finally, tt(main)'s second local object:
