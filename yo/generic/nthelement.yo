        itemization(
            it() The first prototype: all elements in the range rangett(first,
last) are sorted relative to the element pointed to by tt(nth): all elements
in the range rangett(left, nth) are smaller than the element pointed to by
tt(nth), and alle elements in the range rangett(nth + 1, last) are greater
than the element pointed to by tt(nth). The two subsets themselves are not
sorted. The tt(operator<) of the data type to which the iterators point is
used to compare the elements.
            it() The second prototype: all elements in the range rangett(first,
last) are sorted relative to the element pointed to by tt(nth): all elements
in the range rangett(left, nth) are smaller than the element pointed to by
tt(nth), and alle elements in the range rangett(nth + 1, last) are greater
than the element pointed to by tt(nth). The two subsets themselves are not
sorted. The tt(comp) function object is used to compare the elements.
