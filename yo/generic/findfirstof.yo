        it() Description:
        itemization(
            it() The first prototype: the sequence of elements implied by
rangett(first1, last1) is searched for the first occurrence of an element in
the sequence of elements implied by the range rangett(first2, last2). If no
element in the sequence rangett(first2, last2) is found, tt(last1) is
returned, otherwise an iterator pointing to the first element in
rangett(first1, last1) that is equal to an element in rangett(first2, last2)
is returned. The tt(operator==) of the underlying data type is used to compare
the elements in the two sequences.
            it() The second prototype: the sequence of elements implied by
rangett(first1, last1) is searched for the first occurrence of an element in
the sequence of elements implied by rangett(first2, last2). Each element in
the range rangett(first1, last1) is compared to each element in the range
rangett(first2, last2), and an iterator to the first element in
rangett(first1, last1) for which the binary predicate tt(pred) (receiving an
the element out of the range rangett(first1, last1) and an element from the
range rangett(first2, last2)) returns tt(true) is returned. Otherwise,
tt(last1) is returned.
