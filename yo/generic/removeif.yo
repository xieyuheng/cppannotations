        it() Description:
        itemization(
            it() The elements in the range pointed to by rangett(first, last)
are reordered such that all values for which the unary predicate tt(pred)
evaluates as tt(false) are placed at the beginning of the range. The returned
forward iterator points to the first element, after reordering, for which
tt(pred) returns tt(true). The range rangett(returnvalue, last) is called the
em(leftover) of the algorithm. The leftover may contain elements for which the
predicate tt(pred) returns tt(false), but these can safely be removed, as such
elements are also present in the range rangett(first, returnvalue). Such
duplication is the result of the fact that the algorithm em(copies), rather
than em(moves) elements into new locations.
