        it() Function prototypes:
        itemization(
            itt(void push_heap(RandomAccessIterator first,
RandomAccessIterator last);)
            itt(void push_heap(RandomAccessIterator first,
RandomAccessIterator last, Compare comp);)
        )
        it() Description:
        itemization(
            it() The first prototype: assuming that the range rangett(first,
last - 1) contains a valid heap, and the element at tt(last - 1) contains an
element to be added to the heap, the elements in the range rangett(first, last
- 1) are reordered to form a max-heap using the tt(operator<) of the data
type to which the iterators point.
            it() The second prototype: assuming that the range rangett(first,
last - 1) contains a valid heap, and the element at tt(last - 1) contains an
element to be added to the heap, the elements in the range rangett(first, last
- 1) are reordered to form a max-heap using the binary comparison function
object tt(comp) to compare elements.
