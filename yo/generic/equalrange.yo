            it() The first prototype: starting from a sorted sequence (where
the tt(operator<) of the data type to which the iterators point was used to
sort the elements in the provided range), a pair of iterators is returned
representing the return value of, respectively, tt(lower_bound) (returning
the first element that is not smaller than the provided reference value, see
section ref(LOWERBOUND)) and tt(upper_bound) (returning the first element
beyond the provided reference value, see section ref(UPPERBOUND)).
            it() The second prototype: starting from a sorted sequence (where
the tt(comp) function object was used to sort the elements in the provided
range), a pair of iterators is returned representing the return values of,
respectively, the functions tt(lower_bound) (section ref(LOWERBOUND)) and
tt(upper_bound) (section ref(UPPERBOUND)).
