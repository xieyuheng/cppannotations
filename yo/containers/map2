The following members have special meanings with the link(multimap)(MULTIMAP),
but they are defined with the plain tt(map) too:
startit()
    itt(upper_bound(key_type key)): same as the previous function.
    itt(equal_range(key_type key)): a tt(pair<iterator,iterator>) is
returned. In the case of a tt(map), the range consists of the data element
having as its key the key value that is passed to the function. If no such
data element could be found, the pair tt((end(), end())) is returned.  
    )


        ithi(map::lower_bound())(map::iterator map::lower_bound(key): returns
an iterator pointing to the first element having a key equal to or exceeding
the key value that is passed to the member function. If no such value exists,
tt(end()) is returned.
