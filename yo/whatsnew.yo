changes (and occasionally also for the third field of the version number). At
a major version upgrade the entries of the previous major version are kept,

COMMENT(
    it() Version 11.0.0 adds a chapter (ref(CONCEPTS)) about concepts,
        re-introduced into bf(C++) since the C++17 (c++1z) standard. The C++17
        standard also adds em(fold expressions)to the language: covered in
        a sub-section of section ref(VARIADIC).
END)
    it() In version 10.9.0, since the C++17 standard has by now been
        implemented by Gnu's tt(g++) compiler, explicit references to that
        standard were removed. Also, sections covering topics that are no
        longer supported in C++17 (like tt(ptr_fun) and tt(random_shuffle))
        were removed. Lambda expressions are now covered in chapter about
        `Operator Overloading' (chapter ref(OVERLOADING)): lambda expressions
        are compiled by the compiler using standard syntactic rules, and are
        not predefined templates, as provided by the STL. The sections about
        tt(std::system_error) (and friends) were rewritten, and were split
        into sections introducing their facilities (chapter ref(EXCEPTIONS))
        and sections describing how classes can be designed that are accepted
        by tt(system_error) (chapter ref(ADVANCEDTEMPL)). The chapter about
        the STL (chapter ref(STL)) now contains sections covering the
        tt(std::(experimental::)filesystem) namespace.
    it() Version 10.8.0 contains a new section providing an
        overview of new language features introduced by the C++17 standard,
        and many typos and suboptimally formulated statements were fixed.
        Also, coverage of (obsolete) binders, negators and tt(random_shuffle),
        removed by the C++17 standard, was discontinued. 
    it() Version 10.7.2 contains a complete rewrite and re-implementation of
        section ref(OVERLOADBINARY) covering overloading/adding binary
        operators in classes.
    it() Version 10.7.0 adds various sections about the upcoming new C++17
        standard. In addition, the sections about
        overloading binary operators and adding binary operators to existing
        classes were rewritten.
    it() Version 10.6.0 adds a section (Lvalues, rvalues and more) introducing
        some new terms in addition to the familiar terms `lvalue and rvalue';
        adds a new section (Standard Exceptions: to use or not to use?) about
        the distinction between standard and non-standard exceptions;
        describes how to initialize an array of allocated values/POD objects
        using tt(new Type[size]()); the section about explicit conversion
        operators received an overhaul.
    it() Version 10.5.0 contains a partial rewrite of facilities for
        specifying time. It includes functions tt(std::localtime,
        std::gmtime,) and tt(std::put_time) (section ref(TIME)), as well as
        the full table of format specifiers that are recognized by
        tt(put_time).
    it() Version 10.4.0 adds the previously missing section about reference
        bindings (section ref(REFBIND)). This section is a subsection of
        section ref(OVERLOADBINARY), covering overloading binary operators,
        and this latter section, as well as the section covering static
        polymorphism (section ref(STATICPOLY)) was completely 
        rewritten. In addition, the appearance of the html-version of the
        annotations() can now to some extent be fine-tuned by adding CSS
        elements in the top-level file tt(cplusplus.css).
    it() Version 10.3.0 contains new sections about expression templates,
        about at tributes, about shared mutexes, about shared locks, about
        heterogeneous lookups, about sized deallocation functions, and about
        moving and swapping streams; reorganizes the section about lambda
        expressions; and adds additional references to the C++14 standard.
    it() Version 10.2.0 contains a rewrite of the stl's regular expression
        classes, introduces the tt(std::placeholders) namespace and 
        covers the generic tt(bind)-binder. Since C++11 by now is em(de facto)
        the current bf(C++) standard explicit references to it have been
        removed. References to C++14 were kept, and some notes about the
        upcoming C++17 standard were added.
    it() Version 10.1.0 adds several sections about C++11 regular expression
        handling, supported since the C++11 standard, but which was overlooked
        when 10.0.0 was published. Coverage of regular expression handling was
        moved from the Containers chapter to the chapter covering the Standard
        Template Library.
    it() Version 10.0.0 adds a new chapter about multi threading, which is
        formally supported since the C++11 standard. In addition some minor
        topics (e.g., tt(std::distance), some new syntax elements) were added
        to the annotations().
