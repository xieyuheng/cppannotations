In the previous sections the definition and some of the features of typelists
were discussed. Most bf(C++) programmers consider typelists both
exciting and an intellectual challenge, honing their skills in the area of
recursive programming.

But there's more to typelist than a mere intellectual challenge. In the final
sections of this chapter the following topics are covered:
    itemization(
    it() Creating classes from a typelist.nl()
       Here the aim is to construct a new class consisting of instantiations
        of an existing basic template for each of the types mentioned in a
        provided typelist;
    it() Accessing data members from the thus constructed conglomerate class
        by index, rather than name.
    )
    Again, much of the material covered by these sections was inspired by
        hi(Alexandrescu, A.)
    Alexandrescu's (2001) book.
