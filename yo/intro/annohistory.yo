The original version of the bf(C++) Annotations was written by Frank Brokken
and Karel Kubat in Dutch using tt(LaTeX). After some time, Karel rewrote the
text and converted the guide to a more suitable format and (of course) to
English in September 1994.

The first version of the guide appeared on the net in October 1994. By then it
was converted to tt(SGML).

Gradually new chapters were added, and the contents were modified and further
improved (thanks to countless readers who sent us their comment).

In major version four Frank added new chapters and converted the document from
SGML to turl(yodl)(https://fbb-git.github.io/yodl/).
