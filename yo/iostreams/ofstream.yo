The hi(ofstream)tt(std::ofstream) class is derived from the tt(ostream) class:
it has the same capabilities as the tt(ostream) class, but can be used to
i(access files) or i(create files) for writing.

In order to use the tt(ofstream) class  in bf(C++) sources, the
    tthi(fstream) header file must be included. Including tt(fstream) does not
automatically make available the standard streams tt(cin), tt(cout) and
tt(cerr). Include ti(iostream) to declare these standard streams.

The following hi(ofstream constructors) constructors are available for
tt(ofstream) objects:
    itemization(
    itt(ofstream object):
        quote(this is the basic constructor. It defines an tt(ofstream) object
which may be associated with an actual file later, using its tt(open()) member
(see below).
        )
    itt(ofstream object(char const *name, ios::openmode mode = ios::out)):
        quote(this constructor defines an tt(ofstream) object and associates
it immediately with the file named tt(name) using output mode
tt(mode). Section ref(OUTPUTMODES) provides an overview of available output
modes.  Example:
        verb(
ofstream out("/tmp/scratch");
        )
            )
    )
    It is not possible to open an tt(ofstream) using a
 emi(file descriptor). The reason for this is (apparently) that file
descriptors are not universally available over different operating systems.
Fortunately, file descriptors can be used (indirectly) with a
tt(std::streambuf) object (and in some implementations: with a
tt(std::filebuf) object, which is also a tt(streambuf)). tt(Streambuf) objects
are discussed in section ref(STREAMBUF), tt(filebuf) objects are discussed in
section ref(FILEBUF).

    Instead of directly associating an tt(ofstream) object with a file, the
object can be constructed first, and opened later.
    itemization(
        ithtq(open)(void open(char const *name,
                            ios::openmode mode = ios::out))
        (associates an tt(ofstream) object with an actual file. If the
tt(ios::fail) flag was set before calling tt(open) and opening succeeds the
flag is cleared. Opening an already open stream fails. To reassociate a stream
with another file it must first be closed:
        verb(
ofstream out("/tmp/out");
out << "hello\n";
out.close();        // flushes and closes out
out.open("/tmp/out2");
out << "world\n";
        )
        )
        ithtq(close)(void close())
        (closes the tt(ofstream) object. The function sets the ti(ios::fail)
flag of the closed object. Closing the file flushes any buffered information
to the associated file. A file is automatically closed when the associated
tt(ofstream) object ceases to exist.
        )
        ithtq(is_open)(bool is_open() const)
        (assume a stream was properly constructed, but it has not yet been
attached to a file. E.g., the statement tt(ofstream ostr) was executed. When
we now check its status through tt(good()), a non-zero (i.e., em(OK)) value is
returned.  The `good' status here indicates that the stream object has been
constructed properly. It doesn't mean the file is also open. To test whether a
stream is actually open, tt(is_open) should be called. If it returns ti(true),
the stream is open. Example:
        verbinclude(-a examples/isopen.cc)
        )
    )
