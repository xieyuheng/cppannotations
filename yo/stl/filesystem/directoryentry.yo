Objects of the class ti(directory_entry) contain names and statuses of
directory entries. In addition to all standard constructors and assignment
operators it defines a constructor expecting a tt(path):
        verb(
    directory_entry(path const &entry);
        )
    tt(Entry) does not have to exist.

    Its member functions are:
    itemization(
    ithtq(assign)(void assign(path const &dest))
       (the current path is replaced by tt(dest);)

    ithtq(replace_filename)(void replace_filename(path const &dest))
       (the last entry of the current path name (which may be empty if the
        current name ends in a directory separator) is replaced by tt(dest);)

    itht(path)(path const &path() const), hi(operator path const &())
        tt(operator path const &() const):
       quote(returns the current path name;)

    ithtq(status)(file_status status([error_code &ec]))
       (returns type and attributes of the current path name. If the current
        path name refers to a symlink, and the symlink's type and status is
        required, then use ti(symlink_status) (see also section
        ref(FSSTATUS))).
    )

Also, tt(directory_entry) objects may be compared using the tt(==, !=, <, <=,
>,) and tt(>=) operators, returning the result of applying the operator to
their tt(path) objects.
