    Aggregates hi(aggregate initialization)(e.g., structs) can be initialized
using the familiar curly-brace notation. Curly brace notations can also be
used when initializing base-structs of derived-structs. Each base-level struct
receives its own set of curly braces while initializing the derived-level
struct. Here is an example:
        verb(
    struct Base
    {
        int value;
    };
    struct Derived: public Base
    {
        string text;
    };

    // Initializiation of a Derived object:
    
    Derived der{{value}, "hello world"};
    //          -------
    //          initialization of Derived's base struct.
        )
